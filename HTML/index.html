<h1 class="head" id="header"> My Patron Saint</h1>

<p class="words">As a Catholic I had to choose a Saint before I received sacrament of Confirmation. 
The goal is to pick the name of a Saint you admire, can relate to, or aspire to be like. 
This Saint will be bonded to you spiritually and a role model in life. He or she can be the one you turn 
to for guidance and protection. To be honest I don't know why I choose Saint John of the Cross as my 
patron Saint for my Confirmaton. Maybe I was drawn to his name, John, that reminder me one of the Apostle. 
Or perhaps it was the word Cross which associate with Jesus' death. <br>I still wonder about it to this day.</p>
