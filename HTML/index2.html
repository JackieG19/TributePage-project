        <h1>Works by St. John of the Cross</h1>
        
        <p class="words">John left us many books of practical advice on spiritual growth and prayer that are just as relevant 
        today as they were then.</p>

            <li class="title">Ascent of Mount Carmel </li>
            
            <p class="words">One of St. John of the Cross' most important and insightful works, Ascent of Mount Carmel is 
            a brilliant work of Christian mysticism. Considered one of the great Spanish poets, St. John 
            depicts the soul's ascent to Mount Carmel, allegorically, the place of God and the "dark night" 
            that the soul must endure to reach it. St. John describes the different mystic experiences the soul 
            encounters on its way to union with God through the dark night. Although St. John continues to describe 
            the dark night in Dark Night of the Soul, the sequel to Ascent of Mount Carmel, this book provides a 
            hauntingly beautiful, profound, and mystical account of Christian spirituality. It is highly recommended. </p>

                <li class="title">Dark Night of the Soul</li>
                 
                 <p class="words">A sequel and continuation of Ascent of Mount Carmel, 
                 the Dark Night of the Soul is a spiritually moving and mystical book. 
                 In it, St. John of the Cross continues his description of the soul's 
                 journey to the "divine union of the love of God." 
                 A poet at heart, St. John describes the journey and the union with 
                 beautifully rich and deeply symbolic language. However, St. John does 
                 not simply describe the journey; he seems at times to be offering 
                 encouragement and comfort directly to readers as they too struggle with 
                 the excruciating dark night. Offering hope to the downtrodden and discouraged, 
                 the Dark Night of the Soul is one of the most difficult books a person can read, 
                 but its difficulty is surpassed by its reward. One of the most profound works of 
                 Christian mysticism, this book is highly recommended for those seeking union with God. </p>

            <li class="title">A Spiritual Canticle of the Soul and the Bridegroom Christ</li>
            
            <p class="words">	History knows St. John of the Cross, Carmelite friar and priest during the Counter Reformation, 
            not just as an iconic spiritual figure, but also one of Spanish literature. This poem of forty stanzas 
            tells the story of the soul's search for Christ. In it, the soul is portrayed as a bride searching for 
            her bridegroom after having become separated from him. Overall, the poem loosely follows the narrative of 
            Solomon's Song of Songs and can serve as an allegorical reading thereof in light of the Gospel. It is 
            interesting to note that one can even read the poem as an early Spanish translation of Solomon's Song of Songs, 
            as translations of the Bible into the vernacular were forbidden at the time. Even so, this poem is not nor does 
            it claim to be a translation, but rather a literary interpretation.</p>
